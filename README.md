# EJLPhosphene
A simulation of the responses of RGCs to stimulation by an electrode array and reconstruction of the perceived phosphenes.
For use with the 'phosphenePaper' [branch of isetbio](https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio/tree/phosphenePaper).

The [RGC-Reconstruction repo](https://github.com/jamesgolden1/RGC-Reconstruction) is also required.
